   on the currently selected line

There are two ways to trigger this command:

1. By opening the command palette with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and
   typing `Renpy: Warp to current line`
2. The keyboard shortcut
   (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>)

## Configuration

You must set `renpyWarp.sdkPath` to a valid Ren'Py SDK installation.
